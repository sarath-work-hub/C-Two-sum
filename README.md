# Two Sum Problem in C++

This is a warm-up C++ assignment that solves the "Two Sum" problem using an efficient hash map approach.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

### Examples

- Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
  Output: `[0,1]`

- Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`  
  Output: `[1,2]`

- Input: `nums = [3,3], target = 6`  
  Output: `[0,1]`

## Compilation & Execution

Compile the program with:

./twosum
